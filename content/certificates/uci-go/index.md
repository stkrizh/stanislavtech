The specialization includes three courses:
* Getting Started with Go.
* Functions, Methods, and Interfaces in Go.
* Concurrency in Go.

What I learned:

* Gained proficiency in Go syntax, data types, control structures, and error handling to write efficient programs.
* Developed skills in defining and using functions, methods, and interfaces to create modular and reusable code.
* Mastered Go's concurrency model using goroutines and channels to build high-performance concurrent applications.
