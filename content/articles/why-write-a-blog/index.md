There are plenty of reasons **not** to start a blog, such as not having enough time, a lack of writing experience, or not enough knowledge. In order **not** to blog, you might decide that no one will read what you write anyway, or that it’s too bold to share your thoughts publicly. These and many other doubts are common when you think about public writing. And nowadays, to make matters worse, there is overwhelming AI on the scene, able to create content on any topic almost instantly. So, why on earth write a blog at all?

## Learning

Many writers believe that writing helps you learn. To put it more strongly, *writing is learning*. It makes you think in a more organized way, and by writing regularly, you develop clearer, more structured thinking. When you write on a particular subject, your scattered thoughts start to form clear sentences and paragraphs. 

In [one of his essays](https://paulgraham.com/writing44.html), Paul Graham makes the stronger point that writing can *generate new ideas*.

> I think it's far more important to write well than most people realize. Writing doesn't just communicate ideas; it generates them. If you're bad at writing and don't like to do it, you'll miss out on most of the ideas writing would have generated.

A similar opinion was presented by Richard Feynman in his interview with historian Charles Weiner. When the latter looked over a pile of Feynman’s notebooks, he called them a wonderful “record of his day-to-day work”.

> No, no!

— Feynman objected strongly. 

> They aren’t a record of my thinking process. They are my thinking process. I actually did the work on the paper.
    
Beyond those arguments, writing something meaningful usually requires research first. This might mean reading articles and blog posts, watching videos, or listening to podcasts — all of which help you learn your topic. The more you research, the better you understand. Ultimately, research leads to a structured text that cements your knowledge.

## Sharing ideas

Most writers hope — and this is a reasonable aspiration — that some people will read their work. Still, it’s obviously tough to build an audience and become popular only through writing. There are tons and tons of content online every day, making it extremely hard to stand out. Seeking popularity solely through blogging would be very naive. Even so, if a few interested readers come across your blog and find it useful, it means you — the author — have helped someone. It’s somewhat inspiring and worth the effort.

Sharing ideas is not the same as tutoring. A blog is not about teaching — if it’s not literally about teaching, I mean — but rather about sharing your thoughts. Each post is by no means the final truth; it’s an endeavor to understand a topic and to say, “Here is my opinion on this.”

## Portfolio

A blog is a public log of the author’s thinking process. It shows the writer's history of interests, undertakings, and inspirations. It’s a form of public contract; anyone interested can track your progress or your ideas through the posts.

Additionally, most of us change jobs from time to time. When you talk to a new employer, it helps to show yourself in a good light. Your blog can do that for you. A potential employer can see how you write, think, and share ideas. If your blog shows your strengths, it will work in your favor. From a career perspective, your writing is proof of your thinking.

## Skill

Writing is a valuable skill on its own. No matter what your current occupation is, you likely will be able to apply this skill to your work. Good writing helps you create clear documentation, precise reports, and useful notes. It also lets you influence colleagues and communicate better with customers. By writing well, you can convey your ideas more clearly to a larger audience. In other words, the better your writing, the more influential your work.

As with any other skill, it requires practice. By posting regularly on your blog, you keep improving your writing and ultimately your thinking.

## Creative act

As a painter expresses themselves through the canvas, an author articulates their thoughts — or even their personality — through writing. Any piece of meaningful writing can be considered a creative act. By organizing sentences and words, choosing accompanying visuals, and ordering paragraphs, you create something completely new — something that has never been written before, at least not in the exact same form. This act of creation is inspiring in itself.

Expressing your ideas in writing might be a way to enhance your creativity. The more creative you are, the more novel ideas and solutions you can discover. This is also highly beneficial and can be applied to other aspects of your life.
