This is a book written by Gergely Orosz, the author of one of the most famous technology newsletters, [The Pragmatic Engineer](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/). With more than a decade of experience working in Big Tech, he is now a prolific writer with a pretty large audience. His posts about the tech industry are usually highly interesting and insightful.

The book is structured like a ladder, starting with developer career fundamentals and ending with recommendations for Staff and Principal engineers. Each level of the ladder — a part of the book — covers the most important career nuances of that specific level. For entry-level engineers, it discusses valuable coding and software development practices. The parts for seasoned engineers and managers are more focused on software architecture and team dynamics. I believe anyone working in tech can find something helpful in the book, regardless of years of experience.

There are several insightful ideas that I found particularly interesting. 

* A chapter about common career paths in tech companies (**single** vs. **dual** track) can help you choose or evaluate your professional track. It’s a well-structured overview of the current state of tech job opportunities.
* The significance of **getting things done** is discussed several times throughout the book. The author argues — and my own experience completely supports him — that the ability to get things done is a crucial skill for software engineers. The book offers much useful advice for improving in this area.
* Another fascinating idea is the definition of a **product-minded engineer**. Being product-minded in this sense is becoming increasingly valuable in light of the relentless advance of AI in software. Coding skills alone are far from enough.
    > On product teams, engineers who tend to make the most impact are what I call *product-minded engineers*. They are developers with an interest in the product itself; they want to understand why decisions are made, how people use the product, and love being involved in product decisions.

Speaking of the book's downsides — though there aren't many — the author is somewhat repetitive at times. As an example, the repeated emphasis on being kind to your colleagues is slightly annoying. We all know that kindness is a virtue, don’t we? But otherwise, the language and style are really good — the book is easy to read and follow. The author’s writing skills are probably one of the major reasons for his large audience and successful newsletter. He even has a dedicated [blog post](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/on-writing-well/) on the importance of writing well for software engineers, which is worth reading.

To summarize, a major value of the book is that it serves as a reference. You can re-read specific chapters at different stages of your career and still find new insights. My overall impression is really positive, and I would definitely **recommend** ✅ reading this book.
