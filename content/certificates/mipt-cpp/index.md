What I learned:

* Used modern C++ standards, STL containers, and algorithms to write clean and efficient code.
* Built custom unit testing frameworks and practiced modular decomposition to improve maintainability.
* Applied advanced language features (class templates, operator overloading, polymorphism) to design flexible architectures.
* Improved performance using complexity analysis, careful memory management, and move semantics.
