What I learned:
* Mastered core functional programming concepts, including lazy evaluation, recursion, and pattern matching.
* Developed a strong understanding of static typing, parametric and ad-hoc polymorphism, and type classes.
* Learned to manage side effects and state in a pure functional environment using monads (State, IO) and functors.
* Designed and implemented algebraic data types (sums and products) and processed collections using folds and list comprehensions.
