What I learned:

* Applied microservice architecture patterns (API Gateway, Messaging, Saga) to build resilient systems.
* Designed and implemented scalable microservice architectures using Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and decomposition patterns.
* Deployed and orchestrated containerized applications with Docker and Kubernetes, including service discovery and health checks.
* Addressed distributed-systems challenges such as transaction management, eventual consistency, and inter-service communication (REST, gRPC, Messaging).
* Set up monitoring and logging with Prometheus, Grafana, and distributed tracing.
