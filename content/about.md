Hello there! I'm Stanislav, a **software engineer** with around 10 years of experience, currently living in <img src="/img/valencian_community.svg" class="inline not-prose" style="height: 1.2em; vertical-align: middle;"> Valencia, Spain. In my day-to-day work, I primarily use Python and Go.

**My ultimate goal is to build valuable, reliable, and maintainable software products that solve real-world problems.**

I have experience working with modern Python web frameworks, such as FastAPI, AIOHTTP, and Starlette, as well as with good old Django and Flask.

Occasionally, I take courses to deepen my expertise in various areas of software development. [Here are some of the certificates I've earned over the years.](/certificates/)

You can also find some of my articles (in Russian) on [Habr](https://habr.com/ru/users/stkrizh/articles/).
